This project involved creating a course registration system for a school. We developed this program to adhere to database theory for table creation, relations, and constraints. More details can be found in our project write-up in report.pdf.

Steps to run:
* Run src/db/DBBuilder to create tables and populate data.
	- Comment out line 228 and call to dropTables since tables have not yet been created
* Run TextGUI.java to initiate program
* Sample SQL files are stored in the sql folder
